You are in the Experimental branch of the mpiBWA project
In this branch we implement new algorithm for chunking the data before sending them to bwa-mem.
We want to be fast, scalable, accurate and reproducible whatever the number of jobs you chose.

Add an experimental branch for higher scalability, full reproducibility and better accuracy.

Release 1.0 from 29/11/2017

Add a new branch called Experimental. <br />
Warning: This is experimental work do not use in production. But test it and send us reports.<br />

Rationnal:<br />

The master and FULLMPI branches are made for full reproducibility (independant to the number of jobs) and accuracy but they reach the Amdah'ls law point. 
Indeed the locking file RMA implementation (the serialization when computing offsets) introduces a bottle neck we are not able to overpass with RMA technics. <br />
 
This is why we have implemented a new algorithm. Now a lot more master jobs are responsible for chuncking the data the way bwa does and present it to bwa-mem aligner. 
And instead of doing it linearly on the fastq now they do it independently and in parallel. With a little inter communication they adjust the chunks offets and sizes. 
This method removes the serialization bottle neck. <br />

As in the master and FULLMPI branches we obtain a full reproducibility and with a better efficiency and scalability. <br />

When testing this branch make sure the total number of jobs you take is (master jobs) * 8. <br />
8 is the number of aligner threads used by bwa-mem. <br />
According to bwa-mem policy all chunks are 10e6 by the number of threads nucleotide bases big. <br />

Remark: The initial buffer of each master jobs is limited to 2gb (due to mpi_read_at buffer size). <br />
This version does not work on trimmed reads. <br />

First results test on broadwell. <br />

Sample: <br />

NA12878 Illumina 300X 2x150 WGS from GIAB chinese trio.

The alignement is done with 352*8 = 2816 cpu<br />
352 = (Forward Fastq size in gb) / 2g,  8 is thenumber of bwa-mem aligner jobs (8 per master jobs)<br />

MPI parameters :<br />
mpi_run -n 352 -c 8<br />
or : <br />
MSUB -n 352<br />
MSUB -c 8<br />

alignment time: 26 mn<br />
Time to compute chunks: 8s<br />

Reproducibility: the pipeline has been tested tested with 5632 and 2816 cpu results are the same. <br />

Next step:<br />

1) remove initial buffer size limitation<br />
2) support trimmed reads<br />
3) need tests on low throughput infrastructures<br />

Release 1.0 from 21/11/2017

Changes in  LAZYCHUNCK branch:

1) forget a end condition

Release 1.0 from 20/11/2017

Changes in  LAZYCHUNCK branch:
1) remove memory leaks
2) update results section
3) test with 600Gb (x2) fastq files and 100 jobs: ok. (20 mn to approximate chuncks offset) 
4) reproducibility with constant number of jobs: ok.
 
Notes:
If want 100% reproducibility whatever the number of jobs use the master branch or the FULLMPI branch.
But if you want go faster use LAZYCHUNK branch. 
 
Release 1.0 from 17/11/2017

Changes in  LAZYCHUNCK branch

1) Improvement of the algorithm for window sizing.
2) Change the number of bases for the estimation line 541. 

Release 1.0 from 15/11/2017

Changes in LAZYCHUNK branch

1) Due to a mmap in the previous version the virtual memory may be big when the fastq file is large.
Some scheduler like Torque doesn't like this. We review the algorithm of computing chuncks.
first we divide the file in window of size (number of jobs) * 1Gb. On each window jobs approximate chuncks of 10 mega bases.
this way the virtual memory stay low. 
 
2) We also saw problem on some architecture with MPI file read shared we replace it with MPI file read at. 

3) We have also other projects of parallelization (sorting, marking duplicates, clustering... ) and we are looking for people willing to help us for developments and tests. Don't hesitate to contact me (frederic.jarlier@curie.fr). 


Release 1.0 from 30/06/2017

First release

We have implemented a new algorithm.
In this algorithm you have master jobs and aligner jobs.
Master jobs are responsible for computing offset and chunk sizes.
This way all the chuncks have the same number of bases. 
Then master jobs send chunks to bwa-mem and are aligned.
Finally master jobs write ni the result sam file.

the total number of jobs muste be: (number of master) * 8 
8 is the number of threads used by bwa-mem.

First result test on broadwell of TGCC

Condition: Due to mpi_read_at buffer limit of 2g. 
You should limit the initial buffer read to 2gb per master jobs.
Futur release will remove this condition. 

Tested on the SRR2052 WGS with 352*8 cpu 
alignment time: 26 mn
Time to compute chunks: 8s
Scalability : ok
Reproducibility : ok 
Command line :mpi_run -n 352 -c 8
or : MSUB -n 352
MSUB -c 8

This version does not support trimmed read yet.


Requirements
------------

You need a C compiler as required for classic BWA program.

You need to install a version of MPI.

You need a mpi compiler too. to check your mpi installation tell in a command window whereis mpirun, normally it is installed in /usr/bin/mpirun.

You need a low latency network and a parallel file system to use this branch

Your reads should be paired or single.

Options
------

All the BWA-MEM options are available in this version, of course according to the bwa release wrapped. 

Known issues:
-------------

Primary hits are reproduced between the serial version and the parallel but you can see differences in mapping position for alternate contigs. 
This problem stems from the randomization of multi-hits reads. When running with the same number of MPI jobs alternative positions are reproduced but when the number of jobs varies the positions can switch for secondary alignments.

How to integrate further version
--------------------------------

This version of mpiBWA has been build with 0.7.15 BWA version.
To integrate the 0.7.+:

1) git clone the 0.7.+ of BWA.

2) in the folder of bwa copy-pass the following function from mpiBWA:

makefile
main_parallel_version.c 
pidx.c

then make.

Compilation 
-----------

You need automake 1.15 for the installation.
You can install automake and autoconf in differents directories and export the path like this:
export PATH=../automake-1.15/bin:../autoconf-2.69/bin:$PATH

Download from git. In the folder mpiBWA type:
./configure && make install && make

or for distribution:
make dist
tar xzf .tar.gz
cd pbwa7-1.0
./configure && make install && make

for passing mpi path:
./configure CC=mpi_bin_path
add --prefix in configure if you need 

Results are 2 executables pidx and pbwa7.

Build a reference
-----------------
After the creation of the reference file with BWA, you need to build a mapped reference genome. 
To do that: pidx my_ref.fa (where my_ref.fa has been build with BWA).
Pidx build a reference with the extension .map (my_ref.fa.map). 
This reference will be mapped in share memory.

The pidx needs the following files my_ref.fa.sa, my_ref.fa.bwt, my_ref.fa.ann, my_ref.fa.pac, my_ref.fa.amb to construct the fa.map.
 Those files are generated with bwa index. It works also with the fasta.

How to manage the multithreading
----------------

You have the option to use the multithreading options. 
To do that you fix the number of nodes with mpirun and then the number of threads per nodes with the -t.

Examples:

1 server with 8 threads per server:
mpirun -n 1  pbwa7 mem -t 8... 

2 servers with 10 threads per servers
mpirun -n 2  pbwa7 mem -t 10... 

And so on.

Alignment with a scheduler
------------

Example of bash to run the pbwa7 on Torque scheduler

SPLITTED_READS_DIR=../WholeGenomeSampleReads
MAIL="mymail@toto.fr"
PBS_OUTPUT=../OUTPUT
PBS_ERROR=../ERROR
pBWA_BIN_DIR=../mpiBWA
BWA_REF_TMP=../hg19.fasta
SAMPLENAME="MPIBWA"
FILE_TO_ALIGN_R1=../myread_forward.fastq
FILE_TO_ALIGN_R2=../myread_backward.fastq
TOTAL_PROC=600
OUTPUT_DIR=../RESULTS/
FILE_TO_WRITE=../RESULTS/test.sam

//launch the jobs with torque and one job per core (-t 1)
echo " mpirun -n $TOTAL_PROC $pBWA_BIN_DIR/pbwa7 mem -t 1 -o $FILE_TO_WRITE $BWA_REF_TMP $FILE_TO_ALIGN_R1 $FILE_TO_ALIGN_R2" | qsub -o $PBS_OUTPUT -e $PBS_ERROR -N ${SAMPLENAME} -q batch  -l nodes=40:ppn=15

or launch the jobs with mpirun

mpirun -n $TOTAL_PROC $pBWA_BIN_DIR/pbwa7 mem -t 1 -o $FILE_TO_WRITE $BWA_REF_TMP $FILE_TO_ALIGN_R1 $FILE_TO_ALIGN_R2

Results
-------

Here results wo obtain from test realized with TGCC (Très Grand Centre de Calcul - Bruyères le Chatel - France).

![img](Results_TGCC_Broadwell.jpg)

Remarks
-------

1) Do not type the .map extension when you give the reference to pbwa7.

2) Hybrid mode is possible with -t options. MPI rank fix the number of servers and -t options the number of threads per job. 

3) For Lustre or parallel file system users: If you intend to run the mpiSort after the alignment you can tell the striping of the results. 
This is done according to the striping you set in the mpiSort program with the Lustre "lfs setstripe" command (lfs setstripe -c -1 -s 2gb .). 
The "-c -1" option tells Lustre to use all the file system servers and and "-s 2gb" is the size of contigues data blocks. 
For speed purpose reading commands (particularly MPI commands) are aligned on those blocks.

Notes: The striping (like with Hadoop) is the way your data is distributed among servers. This technic accelerates access files and meta file information.

4) Make sure you have the same version of MPI for compiling and running.

5) From our experiences some scheduler do not interpret shared memory and jobs ends up stuck for overloading memory.
In this case take 6gb per job. This is approximately the total reference plus the chunk size.


Future work:
----------

1) Manage the randomization of alternate contigs. To mimic original algorithm.

2) Manage the insert size statistics between jobs.
